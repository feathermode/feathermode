							<p>Web Apps are used predominantly by businesses who offer software as a service or who have a need to provide dynamic functionality that goes beyond your regular contact form. However, we’re pushing every web creator to start converting their websites into Installable Web Apps. These apps operate and function just like native apps that you’d download from the App Store or Play Store, however they can be downloaded right from your website and saved on the users device.

					<h2>Our Process</h2>
					<p>The 5D's of Web Creation is a process we created to provide unique and poignant websites and web apps to clients in a timely and professional manner.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="auto-grid gap-1" data-min-size="30">
					<div class="card">
						<h3>1. Detail</h3>
						<p>In the Detail phase, we establish a project brief by going through a in-depth 1-1 session to figure out what content we have to work with, what content will be needed to launch the site and what the scope of the project is. We'll use the information to create the most appropriate design and infrastructure for your platform</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h3>2. Design</h3>
						<p>In the Design Phase, we'll create a home page that is a mix off of your style preferences and our decisions on the structural necessities for your website or app. Once we confirm the home page we can use the resulting design system to create subsequent pages. We'll review asynchronously throughout the phase and come together at key points.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h3>3. Develop</h3>
						<p>In the Develop Phase, we'll take the green lit designs and hand code the website in a way that is adaptable to any screen, accessible, featherweight and performant. You'll be able to test the website or web app for interactivity and responsiveness.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h3>4. Deploy</h3>
						<p>In the Deploy Phase, we'll hook your website or web app files up to our hosting platform and connect your domain name as well as any other external integrations your platform may need. Once everything is ready to fly, we'll make it live for the world to see.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h3>5. Dedicate</h3>
						<p>By hosting with us, you'll be provided with year-round site maintenance and security as well as privacy-friendly analytics. We only host and dedicate our services to websites and web apps that preserve user privacy and security. Your site is hosted on a platform with a global reach so you can communicate with your audience no matter where they live in the world.</p>

		<section id="faq">
			<div class="wrapper">
				<div class="card width-100">
					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					<details>
						<summary>What web building platform do you use?</summary>
						All of our websites and web apps are custom built. The structure is handcrafted, the styling is bespoke and the databases, content management systems and external integrations are all hardwired according to the particular project.
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
						Every website and web app is different. We handle small portfolio sites for content creators as well as eCommerce stores for startups and solopreneurs. Since, each web platform requires different structural, styling and data needs each project has unique pricing that is tailored to the project. You can find out the pricing for your future platform by <a class="text-underline" href="#sign-up">signing up for a free web consultation with us</a>.
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Why should my business or project take the form of a web app?</summary>
						An installable web app allows you and your audience to have a more intimate relationship. If you run an online store, your audience can download your app to their phone and you can send them notifications when new products are released or when you have updated the company blog. If you're a content creator you can let your audience know when you've published new content. That's just the stratosphere of what is possible with a progressive web app. The bigger you dream the higher you'll fly!
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>How long will it take to put my web platform up on the World Wide Web?</summary>
						It depends. A straightforward blogging website with no web app functionality usually will take 2-4 weeks from the web consultation to deployment. If a project has layers of complexity it will require us to meet more frequently to review design and development decisions.
