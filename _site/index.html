					<p>Web Captain | Oof</p>
					<div class="case-study-content">
						<p>I met with the Artist Retreats team to establish the type of platform they wanted by focusing on the goals they had for their business. They wanted have an easy way for artists to sign up for their classes while providing all of the required information for the workshop. I worked with their Program Director to hone in the branding and design system.</p>
						<img class="case-thumbnail" src="/assets/ar-screen-icons.png" alt="thumbnail of recent work">

						<p>The main factor when it comes to this particular design is finding the right balance of web design and content design. Since this platform was to feature artwork and photography from workshop participants, the mantra was, "let the content speak loudest". So the web design is centered around providing a touch of Sicily on each page while remaining largely out of the way so web visitors could appreciate the art and photography on the website.</p>
						<img class="case-thumbnail" src="/assets/ar-screen-1.png" alt="thumbnail of recent work">

						<p>Each workshop page lead into a checkout process that was straightforward and required the visitor to fulfill one task at a time. Checkouts that require the user to attend to many things at once before moving onto the next step oftentimes discourage the user from continuing. Providing a unique and custom checkout process while maintaining that principle was a primary goal as I designed and developed the site.</p>
						<img class="case-thumbnail" src="/assets/ar-screen-2.png" alt="thumbnail of recent work">

						<p>I had a blast working with the Artist Retreats team and I can't wait to see how their web platform continues to grow.</p>

					<h2>Our Process</h2>
					<p>The 5D's of Web Creation is a process we created to provide unique and poignant websites and web apps to clients in a timely and professional manner.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="auto-grid gap-1 | trigger opacity-0 fade-in">
					<div class="card">
						<h3>1. Detail</h3>
						<p>In the Detail phase, we establish a project brief by going through a in-depth 1-1 session to figure out what content we have to work with, what content will be needed to launch the site and what the scope of the project is. We will use the information to create the most appropriate design and infrastructure for your platform</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h3>2. Design</h3>
						<p>In the Design Phase, we create a home page that is a mix off of your style preferences and our decisions on the structural necessities for your website or app. Once we confirm the home page we can use the resulting design system to create subsequent pages. We will review asynchronously throughout the phase and come together at key points.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h3>3. Develop</h3>
						<p>In the Develop Phase, we take the green-lit designs and hand code the website in a way that is adaptable to any screen, accessible, featherweight and performant. You will be able to test the website or web app for interactivity and responsiveness.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h3>4. Deploy</h3>
						<p>In the Deploy Phase, we hook your website or web app files up to our hosting platform and connect your domain name as well as any other external integrations your platform may need. Once everything is ready to fly, we make it live for the world to see.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
						<h3>5. Dedicate</h3>
						<p>By hosting with us, you will be provided with year-round site maintenance and security as well as privacy-friendly analytics. <strong>We only host and dedicate our services to websites and web apps that preserve user privacy and user data.</strong> Your site is hosted on a platform with a global reach so you can connect with your audience no matter where they live in the world.</p>

			<div class="wrapper">
				<div class="card width-100 | trigger opacity-0 fade-in">
					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					<details>
						<summary>What web building platform do you use?</summary>
						All of our websites and web apps are custom built. The structure is handcrafted, the styling is bespoke and the databases, content management systems and external integrations are all hardwired according to the particular project.
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
						Every website and web app is different. We handle small portfolio sites for content creators as well as eCommerce stores for solopreneurs and startups. Since each web platform requires different structural, styling and data needs each project has unique pricing that is tailored to the project. You can find out the pricing for your future platform by <a class="text-underline" href="#sign-up">signing up for a free web consultation with us</a>.
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Why should my business or project take the form of a web app?</summary>
						An installable web app allows you and your audience to have a more intimate relationship. If you run an online store, your audience can download your app to their phone and you can send them notifications when new products are released or when you have updated the company blog. If you're a content creator you can let your audience know when you've published new content. That's just the stratosphere of what is possible with a progressive web app. The bigger you dream the higher you'll fly!
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>How long will it take to put my web platform up on the World Wide Web?</summary>
						It depends. A straightforward blogging website with no web app functionality usually will take 2-4 weeks from the web consultation to deployment. If a project has layers of complexity it will require us to meet more frequently to review design and development decisions.
